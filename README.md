* **1. Machine Learning A-Z (Udemy-based)**

This material is based on the Udemy course "Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science". The folder was created in 2018. It contains pieces of code in Python and R for a variaty of ML tasks.

* **2. Deploy ML model to AWS (Coursera-based)**

This is Coursera-based project. It's devoted to creating a Flask API ML application (a spam detector) and deploying it with the help of the AWS Elastic Beanstalk technology. 


* **ML-with-Python-Sklearn.ipynb**

A handy Scikit-Learn "cheat sheet" to Machine Learning with Python, mainly consisting of code examples. 
It contains the basic steps needed to implement Machine Learning algorithms successfully: data loading, data preprocessing, creating a model and fitting the data to it, predicting target labels, validating the model and tuning it further to improve its performance:
