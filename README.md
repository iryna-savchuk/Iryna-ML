This folder is created back in 2018 based on the Udemy course "Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science". It contains pieces of code in Python and R for a variaty of ML tasks.

**ML_with_Python.ipynb**

This is a handy Scikit-Learn "cheat sheet" to Machine Learning with Python, mainly consisting of code examples. 
It contains the basic steps needed to implement Machine Learning algorithms successfully: data loading, data preprocessing, creating a model and fitting the data to it, predicting target labels, validating the model and tuning it further to improve its performance:
