* **1. Machine Learning A-Z (Udemy-based)**

Is based on the Udemy course "Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science". Created back in 2018. Contains pieces of code in Python and R for a variaty of ML tasks.

* **2. Deploy ML model to AWS (Coursera-based)**
This is Coursera-based project devoted to building a spam detector using ML, creating a Flask API application and deploying it via AWS Elastic Beanstalk technology. 


* **ML-with-Python-Sklearn.ipynb**

A handy Scikit-Learn "cheat sheet" to Machine Learning with Python, mainly consisting of code examples. 
It contains the basic steps needed to implement Machine Learning algorithms successfully: data loading, data preprocessing, creating a model and fitting the data to it, predicting target labels, validating the model and tuning it further to improve its performance:
